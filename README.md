# Hackable Hackpad!
So hello! I finished my personal hackpad!

I got my inspiration because this is the final project that I needed to make to qualify for Prototype. Even though I thought it was going to be pretty boring, I still powered on, and I found out that it was super fun to make!

I did face some challenges, though. At first, my KiCAD file was broken and somehow corrupted so I had to reset the project. Another thing is that it is my first time using Fusion 360, so I had to Google a few things. Other than that, I honestly did not face any major challenges.

## Here is my BOM:
- 1x XIAO RP2040
- 6x Cherry MX Switches
- 4x SK6812 MINI Leds
- 6x Blank DSA Keycaps
- 4x M3x16 Bolt
- 4x M3 Heatset

Good thing that I have a Bambu Lab A1! Now I don't need to wait for it to be accepted for me to get it printed.

Schematic!            |  PCB!         |   Case!
